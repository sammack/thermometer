# thermometer
Easy to make thermometer using available parts that don't require calibration. 


Building the Firmware 

Use STM32CubeIDE (https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)

For LCD use the  LCD brance, for LED use the LED branch. You can construct the hardware with either LCD support or LED support, but not both!

The PCB design has been modified since the incarnation I used for testing. Please check it before manufacturing it.
